* ******For setup.py script if your firefox is not 102.8.0 (64-Bit) you will need to change the script to your version. I have included the Geckodriver Version i config'd it for, If you are using a diffrent version you will have to change it in the script to the one you are using. Any problems feel free to reach out.****** 
# How it Works
This script uses selenium web driver, and Xvfb and py virtual display to make the web driver invisible so you can keep doing work, this script also uses STEM as the proxy.
